## About Me
Hi there! My name is Lara Garcia, and I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate major with a concentration in Data System Software and Artificial Intelligence & Big Data.
My main experience lies in combining human-centered design and technology to create compelling stories through numbers and visuals, through data analytics, data automation, and data visualization.
my purpose.


This is a repository containing my work regarding the use of geospatial analysis using Esri platforms (ArcGIS, QGIS), data analytics using data visualization tools (Tableau), and application of machine learning algorithms.

## Portfolio Projects
Data Insights Visualization Project - StartUP FIU (entrepreneurship and innovation hub at FIU)

## Study Projects 
Machine Learning Course
- Repository: [Applied Machine Learning](https://github.com/laragarciap/app-machine-learning.git)
- Description: The repository leads to my work from FIU's Applied Machine Learning course, focused on model development and prediction with machine learning algorithms using open source and commercial libraries like ScikitLearn and MicrosoftML. Lessons include using python packages and concepts used in large data analytics with focus on NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, MatPlotLib and Seaborn.
