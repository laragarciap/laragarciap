## About Me
Hi there! My name is Lara Garcia, and I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate major with a concentration in Data System Software and Artificial Intelligence & Big Data.
My main experience lies in combining human-centered design and technology to create compelling stories through numbers and visuals, through data analytics, machine learning, and data visualization.

This is a repository containing my work regarding the use of geospatial analysis using Esri platforms (ArcGIS, QGIS), data analytics using data visualization tools (Tableau), and application of machine learning algorithms.

## Portfolio Projects

Data Science Summer 2022 Intern Projects - Community and National Initiatives Team - Knight Foundation
- Link: [Knight Foundation Final Intern Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFLp4FQYpo/XoFJtgi1FKAjY7F0mEbeQQ/view#1)
- Description: The linked presentation contains an outline of all main projects completed during my 10-week long summer internship, exploring the role of data in philanthropy 1) uncover trends through technology and automation, 2) inform decision-making processes around grantmaking, and 3) inspire and spark new conversations.
  1) Applied different machine learning algorithms (such as k-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling), to derive major themes and topics across more than 50 years of grant data
  2) Developed a geospatial analysis tool using a Python-based data visualization tool developed by Uber, kepler.gl, to help illustrate how public space investment proposals translate to real-world equitable access, or how an individual can reach a given public space within a reasonable and realistic timeframe.
  3a) Developled data visualizations using kepler.gl based on data provided from one of KF’s investments called Kiwibots, which are small personal delivery robots that were deployed in 3 of our Knight cities to conduct their pilot program, and simultaneously collect data of curb ramps and sidewalks.
  3b) Built a natural language processing tool that was able to analyze grant text data, to create a digital art piece that showcases a randomly generated condensed sentence in the form of “To + verb + noun” based on each grant since 1964. The purpose of this project was to transform our existing grant data into a more dynamic and inspiring display of all of KF’s work, to inspire KF staff, and spark interesting conversations.


Data Insights Visualization Project - StartUP FIU (entrepreneurship and innovation hub at FIU)

- Description: The linked presentation contains reflections and summaries of my role as an undergraduate researcher with the MIT Media Lab. Includes detail on work regarding geospatial analysis completed to inform the decision-making process behind the strategic implementation of mobile health clinics.

- Link 2: [Research Paper regarding Strategic Implementation of Mobile Health Clinics](https://github.com/laragarciap/geospatial-analysis-mit/blob/11a5bad0ef749fda6695f3b79f07c3af218187aa/ARCH%20Final%20Draft-%20Strategic%20Implementation%20of%20Mobile%20Health%20Clinics.pdf)
- Description: The linked document consists of an extensive research paper studying the strategic implementation of mobile health clinics to procure the prevention of drastic medical measures, such as amputations of diabetic individuals, by providing greater accessibility to healthcare. Details include development of framework proposal using GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and suggestions of using technologies such as satellite imagery to determine logistics behind stationing of mobile health clinics (MHC's)


## Study Projects 
Machine Learning Course
- Repository: [Applied Machine Learning](https://github.com/laragarciap/app-machine-learning.git)
- Description: The repository leads to my work from FIU's Applied Machine Learning course, focused on model development and prediction with machine learning algorithms using open source and commercial libraries like ScikitLearn and MicrosoftML. Lessons include using python packages and concepts used in large data analytics with focus on NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, MatPlotLib and Seaborn.
