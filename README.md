## About Me
Hi there! My name is Lara Garcia, and I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate major with a concentration in Data System Software and Artificial Intelligence & Big Data.
My main experience lies in combining human-centered design and technology to create compelling stories through numbers and visuals, through data analytics, data automation, and data visualization.



This is a repository containing my work regarding the use of geospatial analysis using Esri platforms (ArcGIS, QGIS), data analytics using data visualization tools (Tableau), and application of machine learning algorithms.

## Portfolio Projects
Data Insights Visualization Project - StartUP FIU (entrepreneurship and innovation hub at FIU)
- Link: [Data Insights Visualization Presentation](https://github.com/laragarciap/startupfiu-data-analytics/blob/43f8a64f768ad82cd6c11e7edbd77e9cd15f4f38/Data%20Insights%20Comprehensive%20Presentation.pdf)
- Description: The linked presentation is the culmination of a data analytics projects, totaling to the collection of insights of over 140+ unique events and 15000+ unique students from 2016 to 2020, as well as making strategic reccomendations for future logistics of offerings and programming


Applied Epidemiology and Mapping Project - MIT Media Lab

- Description: The linked presentation contains reflections and summaries of my role as an undergraduate researcher with the MIT Media Lab. Includes detail on work regarding geospatial analysis completed to inform the decision-making process behind the strategic implementation of mobile health clinics.

- Link 2: [Research Paper regarding Strategic Implementation of Mobile Health Clinics](https://github.com/laragarciap/geospatial-analysis-mit/blob/11a5bad0ef749fda6695f3b79f07c3af218187aa/ARCH%20Final%20Draft-%20Strategic%20Implementation%20of%20Mobile%20Health%20Clinics.pdf)
- Description: The linked document consists of an extensive research paper studying the strategic implementation of mobile health clinics to procure the prevention of drastic medical measures, such as amputations of diabetic individuals, by providing greater accessibility to healthcare. Details include development of framework proposal using GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and suggestions of using technologies such as satellite imagery to determine logistics behind stationing of mobile health clinics (MHC's)


## Study Projects 
Machine Learning Course
- Repository: [Applied Machine Learning](https://github.com/laragarciap/app-machine-learning.git)
- Description: The repository leads to my work from FIU's Applied Machine Learning course, focused on model development and prediction with machine learning algorithms using open source and commercial libraries like ScikitLearn and MicrosoftML. Lessons include using python packages and concepts used in large data analytics with focus on NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, MatPlotLib and Seaborn.
